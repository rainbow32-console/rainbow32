# Example project

Note: as you may have noticed, assets/audio contains `bg-music.mp3` and `bg-music1.mp3`. But the author of the music doesn't allow me to publish it here (totally understandable), so in order for everything to work correctly, you will have to find custom tracks and put them here. Removing these tracks should not break anything, just the music won't play.
